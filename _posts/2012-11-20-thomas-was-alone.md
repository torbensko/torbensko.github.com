*Thomas Was Alone* is another of those indie games that presents itself in a well-polished and eye-catching package. The visuals are crisp and distinctively simple. The inclusion of an engaging narrative provides a kooky edge that sees it join that upper-indie echelon. However, despite having all the trailer-friendly hallmarks of a standout title, the gameplay just doesn't stand up.

In Thomas Was Alone, you see yourself guiding Thomas and his friends – each being simple blocks of colour – around a classic platformer setting. The goal of each level is to get your blocks to a specific location, having overcome a range of logical and dexterous tasks. Each block has their own characteristics with, for instance, the smaller and wider blocks being slower and less agile (note to developers: slow and cumbersome doesn't tend to lend itself to enjoyable play). The levels offer ever-changing tasks, providing some variation to game, but simply not enough.

There's no crazy novel gameplay mechanic here – it's all pretty rudimentary problem-solving and platforming. The challenges put forth don't so much lend themselves to addictive play, but are, rather, pretty arduous. Having to laboriously act out the solution to a scenario (after having realised how to accomplish it long before) makes the game drag. Similarly, seeing your character plummet to the bottom of the level due to a mistimed jump never ceases to frustrate. By midway through the game, I was finding it more of a chore to play than anything. I know there will be a clique of people who will love this repetitive and understated gameplay, but I'm not one of them. I highly admire the artistic style of this game, but there's not enough novelty, reward or variation to hold me.

That said, one of the aspects that does give this game some appeal is the narration. Voiced by the well-touted Danny Wallace (I also don't know who he is other than being described as a poor man's Stephen Merchant), the narration continues throughout the game. Illustrating what good writing and solid voice performance can do, the narration injects some interest into a scenario that otherwise consists of jumping blocks. However, as with most of these indie games, it doesn't really go anywhere. The game offers little closure, with the ending being particularly underwhelming.

All that said, it's worth keeping in mind that this is a one-man-made game and, for that reason, I highly commend it. However, that doesn't alter the fact that the gameplay is pretty lacking. If you like minimalist and unforgiving platforming, this one is for you. In the meantime, I'm going to continue to join the rest of the world munging out on the annual *COD* offering.

This video explains how YouTube can play a vital role in conducting online research. It was accepted into the 2012 CHI conference as a video submission and subsequently won the Best Video (the Golden Mousey) award. Details of the publication (originally titled "Video mediated recruitment for online studies"), can be found at: <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2212476" target="_blank" title="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2212476">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2212476</a>

Most of the content in the video is my own. The soundtrack, "Up and Down" (taken from the album, "Mr. Hadopi"), was created by Vicnet and is available from freemusicarchive.org Some other sounds have been taken from freesound.org. A special thank you goes to fellow YouTube user, Robbaz, for allowing me to use some of his footage.

This year is shaping up to be a pretty big one in gaming. First and foremost is the expected arrival of both Sony's and Microsoft's next machines. While little is known about the PS4, including its name, the new Xbox (simply known as ‘Xbox’) will be packing the next Kinect. It’s speculated that the Kinect 2 will rival the quality of a commercial motion capture system and track your whole living room through the use of multiple sensors. To this, Microsoft have also demonstrated a system that extends the limits of your TV by projecting onto the wall behind it. A preview video of the system looks pretty sweet. While not necessarily a practical aid, it looks to make the game experience a more immersive one.

Other hardware news includes the release of several Android-based consoles. The first notable entry is Ouya, which raised over $8.5 million on Kickstarter. A few more systems have since been announced, including GameStick - a console compact enough it can reside within and be powered by your TV's HDMI port, thereby game-enabling your TV. Not one to be left behind, Nvidia are also releasing an Android console - or should I say controller, given the unit is one and the same. The handheld system includes a detachable, multi-touch screen, allowing it to be used as a standalone device. It can also impressively stream to a 4K TV - that's over 7 million pixels per frame.

As a lucky coincidence, several "affordable" 4K TVs are also planned for released, with Sony leading the charge. It's suspected that Apple will enter the TV game this year. Prior to his passing, Steve Jobs claimed he had finally cracked the TV. Presumably this "cracking" will involve Siri. This could be bad news for Sony. Apple and Google make more money from mobile games than Nintendo and Sony combined. As a result, Sony find themselves in a perilous financial situation, with it being possible that few more flops could see the demise of this former gaming giant. Another screen technology on offer includes the Oculus Rift - a VR headset that people finally seem happy to wear. Funded by Kickstarter and backed by the likes of Gabe Newell (Valve), John Carmack (id) and Cliff Bleszinski (Epic), the device is apparently awesome to use.

Also of note is the release of the Piston, the first PC built to solely run Steam. The machine comes as the first attempt to make PC gaming more accessible. Despite not being the official Steam box, Valve are working closely with the developer. Valve will be later releasing their own machine, codenamed Bigfoot, which is believed to released in 2014. Excitingly, Valve claim their homegrown offering won't be closed, insomuch you can install your own OS, and will support eight controllers and multiple screens. Hopefully this means each player could get their own screen.

All up, 2013 is shaping up to be pretty interesting. To that, next issue we'll look at some of the exciting game releases coming up.

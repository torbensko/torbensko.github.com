In 2004, Valve put out a remake of their classic 1998 title Half-Life using their latest and greatest game engine. Entitled Half-Life: Source, the game was a rather lacklustre reboot. After being slightly criticised for their efforts, Gabe Newell, Valve's larger-than-life co-founder, a man apparently valued at $1.5 billion, rather ingeniously (or at least lazily) claimed that fans would eventually do the job for them. Eight years on and his prophecy has finally come true.

Black Mesa is an entirely fan-made remake of Half-Life (albeit without Zen). The level scenery and model have received a complete overhaul, whilst staying remarkably true to the source material (nerdy in-joke intended). Given how archaic the development tools are, the amount of effort involved in creating this boggles the mind, which may explain why it's taken eight years to finally come to fruition.

As testament to their efforts, the game is very entertaining and of extremely high quality. Whereas with Half-Life: Source, in which there just wasn't enough to sustain more than a curious peek, this attempt should see you playing through to the end. In doing so, it’s interesting to note how the retro gameplay compares to the modern, balls-to-wall-style shooters. Most noticeably, the pacing is a fair bit slower, with the first two chapters moving along at a geriatric pace. Back in the day, this was fine. But that was at a time where a movie could show a well-rendered dinosaur's head for half the film because it looked ‘sweet’. These days, little Johnny can create that kind of stuff whilst he plays with himself in his bedroom, thereby somewhat diminishing its impact.

I realise that the goal of this game is to be faithful to the original and there's no doubt a cohort of gamers would be offended (and would possibly cry) if they had done it any other way. However, this safe approach is ultimately a little boring. I would have preferred to see them give their own take on the series. There's a real skill and risk in reimagining something so well-loved; injecting it with something new, yet still honouring the old. At times, the game does this well, with the outdoor areas looking particularly impressive. For the most part though, the game feels constrained by the limitations of yesteryear.

A good way to put this game into perspective is by considering whether I would pay money for it. I concede that I would – but realistically, not much. Their eight years of effort have essentially translated into an elongated trip down memory lane, seeing a 14-year-old game engine being replaced with a five-year-old one. That said, I haven't forgotten that this is a fan-made project and for that reason – it’s freaking impressive.

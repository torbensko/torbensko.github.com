There's a proven recipe to making a successful indie game. Firstly, get a well-known form of gameplay and inject a novel mechanic. Add to this an artistic style and finish by injecting a quirky story. For the best results, avoid giving closure. Such a formula has worked wonders for Limbo and Journey, and now the same can be said for The Unfinished Swan.

The Unfinished Swan features several standout elements that help justify the price of admission. Most obvious is the eye-candy. The geometric-centric scene design, in its simplicity, looks awesome. The game uses very little colour, focusing on shadows and tone. The resulting effect looks as compelling as an Escher painting. Also worth noting is the overall polish of the game, with sublimely crafted menus and cutscenes.

The gameplay is also very engaging. At the start of the game you'll find yourself navigating an entirely white world by adding many a splash of paint around the place. When glancing back at your efforts, the decor is left looking like an unfinished painting – tying nicely into the game's theme. Not resting on one mechanic, the game quickly changes this up, making the two or three hours’ gameplay compelling throughout. Commendably, the game does well to weave this mix of gameplay elements into the narrative. However, this variation comes at the cost of making the gameplay style a bit skittish, with the Tron-esque moments feeling particularly out of place.

While all of these perks make for a game that is immersive, I can't say I found it equally engaging. As with many indie titles, the game refrains from including a strong narrative. The game does build some steam near the end, but at no point does your character really have an overarching goal or purpose. While this storytelling ambiguity makes for a more mysterious and arty experience, it does so at the expense of making the game feel a bit aimless. Without any purpose, the game relies on the rich visuals and quirky gameplay to hold your attention. They admittedly do this very well, but by the end I was still left feeling unsatisfied. It's kinda like having a snack; brief and enjoyable, but ultimately leaves you hungry.

In summary, this is the kind of game I would be keen to show my more artistically inclined friends; however, I wouldn't be as quick to recommend others to buy it. That said, that comes from the perspective of someone who has played quite a few of these indie games; if you are yet to stray away from the mainstream then this is a good title with which to get started.

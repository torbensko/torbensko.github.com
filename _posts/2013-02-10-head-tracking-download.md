*Quick link: [MediaFire download](http://www.mediafire.com/?jh4xn3y21owqxa7)*

For my PhD, I created a FPS game that used head tracking to allow players to perform an in-game lean movement using their own head movements. It simultaneously replicates the shaky-cam effect used in films in order to make the game feel more realistic and immersive.

Having recently removed the link whilst I cleaned up and improved the code, I've now placed a version of this on [MediaFire](http://www.mediafire.com/?jh4xn3y21owqxa7). This version of the game has the following features:

- Some minor updates to the head tracking logic. For example, undesirable offsets along the pitch and yaw canceled out. The smoothing logic has also been altered to be more responsive.
- A new head tracking settings panel and map loading panel have been added.
- The previous study logic has been removed, so there are no longer any surveys or consent forms to read through.

If you would like to improve upon the system, feel free to download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/torbensko/HAL). You can also find a video of the system on YouTube:

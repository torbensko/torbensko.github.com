This program cycles through a mix of user provided content (images, video and text), in
manner that is visually captivating. It is well suited to foyer and marketing
displays. For example, the system has been used in a university context to display the following:

*	The work of a *research group* by showing the details of some of the projects undertaken by the group.
*	An *undergraduate course* via examples of students work.
*	A *special interest group*, such as a Computer Science Student Association (CSSA), by showing images from several of the group events.

Some of the key features of the system include:

*	Easy, one-time set up for each display computer.
*	Beyond the set up, the system does not require an internet connection, allowing it to (theoretically) run indefinitely.
*	It only requires the Chrome web-browser, making it easy to set up, free and cross-platform.
*	It includes a script to help set up a computer from scratch. The script allows an operational period to be specified, ensuring each display computer can run unaided.
*	The system automatically determines how best to display the user-provided content. The user need only provide their content.
*	Includes support for text, images, video and [Processing](www.processing.org) artworks.

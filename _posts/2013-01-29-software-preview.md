 Having originally planned to cover both the software and hardware releases of 2013 in the last issue, it quickly became apparent there was too much to fit it into one column. So this issue we focus on some of the software hitting our shelves this year. As expected, many of the AAA titles are back. Among the ranks is *Battlefield 4*, *Crysis 3*, *Metal Gear Rising* and *Metal Gear Ground Zeros* (ooh, double dip!), *God of War Ascension*, *Gears of War Judgement*, *StarCraft 2: Heart of the Swarm*, *Splinter Cell Blacklist* and some others I probably forgot.

Rockstar also return with their most sophisticated offering yet, which in some regards puts me off. I found *GTA IV* very disappointing, with the realism coming at the cost of the goofy gameplay. Here's hoping *GTA V* doesn't fall further into that trap. Many people are also getting excited about the new *Tomb Raider*, which looks to reinvigorate the series by ripping off *Uncharted* wholesale. I'm still yet to be convinced by this one, as I can't imagine I'll be doing much in addition to what I already did five years ago. The same may be true of Naughty Dog's new offering, *The Last of Us*, but we'll see.

*BioShock* also returns, straying well away from its watery past. The new title, *Infinity*, is set amongst the clouds in an Uncle Sam-style floating city. With it comes a whole new set of gameplay mechanics that should reinvigorate the series. Another title straying from its roots is *Dead Space 3*. It’s still set on a big scary spaceship, but this time you'll be doing it all with a buddy. It will be interesting to see whether they can still keep up the tension when you're able to hold your mate's hand. Either way, I do love a good co-op game. The horror genre has several other notable entries including *Amnesia: A Machine for Pig*, follow up to one of the scariest titles, *Outlast*, featuring infrared camera moments, and *Slender: The Arrival*, with its strong psychological angle.

Point-and-click adventure game fans should be excited to know that Tim Schafer, of *Grim Fandango*, returns with the Kickstarter-backed *Double Fine Adventure* game (a working title, with any luck). Some other quirky originals include the likes of *South Park: The Stick of Truth*, which sees both Trey Parker and Matt Stone pro-actively involved in the development. The creator of *Minecraft* also returns with *0x10c*, aboard a spaceship with a reprogrammable computer (‘I can't let you do that, Dave’). *DayZ* also gets its official release, having originally been slated for last year. Encouragingly, the setback has been because they've decided to overhaul it more than originally planned. Another title to keep an eye on is *Watch Dogs*, which boasts some of the most hard-hitting action I've seen in a while.

All in all, there's some great stuff to look forward to this year, so start saving up.

Unfortunately, the FaceOff game has been temporarily taken down, whilst I finish off migrating my website. I'll put up a new version of the system within the next fortnight. 

Feel free to grab the source code from [GitHub](http://github.com/torbensko/HAL). Please <a href="mailto:me@torbensko.com">send me an email</a> if you want to be informed when the game is available.

The FaceOff game has been temporarily taken down whilst I migrate my website. I'll be putting a new version of the game up within the next fortnight - this being posted on the 10th Dec 2012.

In the mean time, feel free to grab the source code from [GitHub](http://github.com/torbensko/HAL). You can also <a href="mailto:me@torbensko.com">send me an email</a> if you want to be informed when the game is available.

Thanks
